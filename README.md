# HypeLessLi - Extension

HypeLessLi helps you critically read scientific texts by highlighting hype-like, subjective, promotional, and vague terms in **yellow**.  
It also provides a **collapsible sidebar** with explanations, counts, and navigation through all occurrences.

NOTE: This is primarily the development side; for the most reliable public code, refer to the published version at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16813943

## Highlighted Terms

These words/phrases are flagged for being potentially subjective, hype-driven, or vague in scientific writing (default list in `terms.js`):

- extreme  
- groundbreaking  
- cutting-edge  
- revolutionary  
- novel  
- unique  
- breakthrough  
- state-of-the-art  
- exciting  
- unprecedented  
- best  
etc.

---

## Why These Terms Are Flagged

These terms often:
- Overstate results
- Add subjective evaluation instead of objective data
- Make novelty claims that should be clear from context
- Use vague or promotional metaphors
- Risk making the writing less precise or more marketing-like

HypeLessLi encourages **clear, precise, and evidence-based** scientific communication.

## New Functionalities & Bugfixes

HypeLessLi has been updated with the following improvements over the original version:

### Manual Activation
- Extension now only runs when you **click the extension icon** in the browser toolbar.
- No longer automatically activates on every page load.
- Prevents unwanted highlighting on non-scientific content.

### Dark Mode
- Automatically adapts to system settings (`prefers-color-scheme: dark`).
- Uses darker sidebar and tooltip styles for readability.

### Animation Feedback
- Highlight flashes smoothly when clicked or previewed.
- Subtle transitions for highlight colors.

### Help Button
- Sidebar includes an **Info** button.
- Opens a popup with instructions on how to use the extension.

### Resizable Sidebar
- Sidebar width can be adjusted by dragging its edge.
- Minimum width: 180px, Maximum width: 500px.

### Hover Tooltips
- Hovering over a highlighted word shows an **explanation tooltip**.
- Helps users understand why a word was flagged without opening the sidebar.

### Exceptions to Reduce False Positives
- Added an **exceptions list** in `terms.js`.
- Example: *"benchmark test"*, *"unique identifier"*, *"extreme value theory"*, etc., will **not** be flagged.

### Visible Text Only
- Fixed bug where hidden metadata or SEO text caused **false matches** (e.g., "best (1)").
- Now scans only **visible text** (ignores `display:none`, `visibility:hidden`, and `aria-hidden`).

---

## Limitations

- Works best on **visible webpage text** (not PDFs).
- Uses keyword matching, so borderline cases may still appear.
- Term list and exceptions can be expanded in `terms.js`.
- Must be manually activated on each page by clicking the extension icon.

---


## Experimental: AI Q&A (Optional)

HypeLessLi includes an **experimental AI Q&A feature** in the sidebar, allowing you to ask questions about hype terms and get suggestions for more objective alternatives.

**Note:**
- This feature requires running a local backend server (see `groq-backend.js`) and a valid Groq API key (put into a local .env file).
- If the backend is not running, the AI Q&A section will not function.
- The main extension features work independently of the AI Q&A.
